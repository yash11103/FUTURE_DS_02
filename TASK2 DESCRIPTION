1. Data Preparation
The project involved several ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) steps and data modeling to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis:


Data Cleaning: Power Query was used to handle missing values and perform data transformations. This included cleaning customer demographic data (age, gender) and account details.
+3


Data Modeling: A robust data model was established within Power BI, linking customer tables with service usage and contract information.
+2


Feature Engineering: New columns were likely created to categorize customers into segments like "Tenure Groups" (e.g., 0-6 months, 1-2 years) to identify when churn is most likely to occur.

DAX Measures: Custom DAX measures were developed to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs), including:


Total Churn & Churn Rate: To track the percentage of customers leaving.
+1


Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): To understand the financial impact of retention.

2. Analysis Performed
The analysis focused on identifying patterns and drivers of customer attrition:


Churn Driver Identification: Evaluated which factors—such as high monthly charges, contract type, or lack of technical support—most strongly correlated with churn.
+1


Contract & Account Analysis: Compared the churn rates between "Month-to-month" contracts and long-term annual plans.


Service Impact Analysis: Investigated how specific services (like Online Security or Tech Support) affected customer loyalty.


Demographic Profiling: Analyzed churn rates across different age groups and geographic regions to find high-risk segments.


Tenure Trends: Identified critical "danger zones" in the customer lifecycle, such as the first six months of service.

3. Business Recommendations
Based on the dashboard's findings, the following strategies are recommended to improve retention:


Incentivize Long-Term Contracts: Offer discounts or value-added services to transition "Month-to-month" customers to annual contracts, as these users have lower churn rates.


Targeted Support Bundles: Proactively offer technical support and online security services to high-risk segments, as customers with these services tend to stay longer.


Early Intervention Programs: Launch specific engagement campaigns (e.g., check-in calls or loyalty rewards) for customers in their first six months of tenure.


Pricing Strategy Review: Evaluate the pricing for high-tier plans that show high attrition to ensure the perceived value matches the monthly cost.


Personalized Retention Offers: Use the dashboard's filtering capabilities to identify specific regions or demographic groups with high churn and deploy localized marketing tactics.
