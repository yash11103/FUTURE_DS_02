Customer Churn Analysis - Power BI

📌 Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer retention and churn patterns. By leveraging Power BI, I have transformed raw customer data into an interactive dashboard that identifies high-risk segments and key factors driving customer attrition.
The goal is to provide actionable insights that help businesses improve retention strategies and maximize customer lifetime value.

📊 Key Features

Churn Rate Overview: At-a-glance view of the total churn percentage and customer loss.
Demographic Analysis: Breakdown of churn by age, gender, and geography.
Account Information: Analysis of contract types (Month-to-month vs. Annual), payment methods, and tenure.
Service Usage: Insights into how specific services (Internet, Tech Support, etc.) impact the likelihood of a customer leaving.
Interactive Filters: Drill down into specific customer segments to find localized issues.

🛠️ Tools Used

Power BI Desktop: For data modeling and visualization.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used to create custom measures for churn rates and KPIs.
Power Query: For data cleaning and transformation (ETL).

Data Preparation

The project involved several ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) steps and data modeling to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis:
Data Cleaning: Power Query was used to handle missing values and perform data transformations. This included cleaning customer demographic data (age, gender) and account details.
Data Modeling: A robust data model was established within Power BI, linking customer tables with service usage and contract information.
Feature Engineering: New columns were likely created to categorize customers into segments like "Tenure Groups" (e.g., 0-6 months, 1-2 years) to identify when churn is most likely to occur.
DAX Measures: Custom DAX measures were developed to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs), including:
Total Churn & Churn Rate: To track the percentage of customers leaving.
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): To understand the financial impact of retention.

Analysis Performed

The analysis focused on identifying patterns and drivers of customer attrition:
Churn Driver Identification: Evaluated which factors—such as high monthly charges, contract type, or lack of technical support—most strongly correlated with churn.
Contract & Account Analysis: Compared the churn rates between "Month-to-month" contracts and long-term annual plans.
Service Impact Analysis: Investigated how specific services (like Online Security or Tech Support) affected customer loyalty.
Demographic Profiling: Analyzed churn rates across different age groups and geographic regions to find high-risk segments.
Tenure Trends: Identified critical "danger zones" in the customer lifecycle, such as the first six months of service.

💡 Insights Gained

Customers with Month-to-Month contracts show a significantly higher churn rate compared to those on long-term plans.
Users without Tech Support services are 2x more likely to churn.
High monthly charges correlate with increased attrition in the first 6 months of tenure.

Business Recommendations
Based on the dashboard's findings, the following strategies are recommended to improve retention
Incentivize Long-Term Contracts: Offer discounts or value-added services to transition "Month-to-month" customers to annual contracts, as these users have lower churn rates.
Targeted Support Bundles: Proactively offer technical support and online security services to high-risk segments, as customers with these services tend to stay longer.
Early Intervention Programs: Launch specific engagement campaigns (e.g., check-in calls or loyalty rewards) for customers in their first six months of tenure.
Pricing Strategy Review: Evaluate the pricing for high-tier plans that show high attrition to ensure the perceived value matches the monthly cost.
Personalized Retention Offers: Use the dashboard's filtering capabilities to identify specific regions or demographic groups with high churn and deploy localized marketing tactics.
