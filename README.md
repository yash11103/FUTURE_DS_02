Customer Churn Analysis - Power BI

📌 Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer retention and churn patterns. By leveraging Power BI, I have transformed raw customer data into an interactive dashboard that identifies high-risk segments and key factors driving customer attrition.


The goal is to provide actionable insights that help businesses improve retention strategies and maximize customer lifetime value.

📊 Key Features

Churn Rate Overview: At-a-glance view of the total churn percentage and customer loss.

Demographic Analysis: Breakdown of churn by age, gender, and geography.

Account Information: Analysis of contract types (Month-to-month vs. Annual), payment methods, and tenure.

Service Usage: Insights into how specific services (Internet, Tech Support, etc.) impact the likelihood of a customer leaving.

Interactive Filters: Drill down into specific customer segments to find localized issues.

🛠️ Tools Used

Power BI Desktop: For data modeling and visualization.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used to create custom measures for churn rates and KPIs.

Power Query: For data cleaning and transformation (ETL).


💡 Insights Gained


Customers with Month-to-Month contracts show a significantly higher churn rate compared to those on long-term plans.

Users without Tech Support services are 2x more likely to churn.

High monthly charges correlate with increased attrition in the first 6 months of tenure.
